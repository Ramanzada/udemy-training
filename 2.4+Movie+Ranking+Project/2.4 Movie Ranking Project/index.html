    <h1>The Best Movies Accroding to Raman</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h4>Infinity Pool:</h4>
    <p>
      Directed by Brandon Cronenberg, "Infinity Pool" is praised for its blend
      of satire, psychedelic sexuality, and sci-fi body horror. The film's
      commitment by stars like Mia Goth and Alexander Skarsgard to their roles
      provides a unique hallucinogenic clarity to its narrative. It is notable
      for its "Cronenbergian perversion," offering a visceral experience for
      audiences seeking something beyond conventional horror
    </p>
    <h4>Talk to Me:</h4>
    <p>
      This film represents a blend of teen horror excitement with deeper
      emotional violence, reflecting the current transitional state of the
      horror genre. Directed by the RackaRacka duo, it brings an
      "anything-can-happen" feeling back to horror, engaging audiences with its
      dark themes including suicide and psychosis, while still providing a
      thrilling experience
    </p>
    <h4>Evil Dead Rise:</h4>
    <p>
      Part of the "Evil Dead" franchise, this installment stands out for being a
      fun and over-the-top bloodbath set in an almost deserted apartment
      building. It's lauded for delivering everything fans could hope for, while
      still pushing the franchise forward, proving the series' enduring appeal
      and versatility in delivering quality horror
